For your application, design:

1. a UML domain model (i.e. class diagrams) covering the main classes
-incl. association, inheritance, and aggregation relations
-observe the general modeling guidelines and make use of Responsibility Driven Design (RDD) and use CRC-Cards as a tool.

2. based on your domain classes, create two UML sequence diagrams, one each for the following situations
-when the user updates some specific information
-when the system alerts the user about some specific event

3. if necessary, refine your UML domain model to include the attributes and operations needed for your sequence diagrams.
