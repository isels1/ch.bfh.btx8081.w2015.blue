Design a Web-based, mobile application for your target user by following the Design Thinking Process:
1.Scoping
-define: project scope, out of scope, and success measures
2.Research
-investigate: literature, case studies, state of the art systems, …
-conduct: one interview and/or field study
3.Synthesize
-collect, order, and analyze all material in your group
-define: 2 or more personas as target user(s) for your application
-define: main features (i.e., user requirements)
4.Design
-design storyboards
-at least 2 storyboards per team member
-discuss and iterate
-make sure your storyboards are detailed enough to show the usage of a real system
5.Prototype
-build 3 cardboard-based prototypes for your 3 most promising storyboards
6.Validate
-test your storyboards/prototypes with friends or family (i.e., outside this class)
-first define your evaluation questions
-then how you will find the answer
