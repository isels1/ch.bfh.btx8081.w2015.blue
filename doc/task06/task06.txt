External Perspective

1. 
Design a context model showing the boundary of your application
and other external systems needed to implement your system
requirements.

2. 
Design a high level activity diagram showing the interaction and
thereby the interfaces with external systems. Use the notation of
activity partitions to depict the responsibility of your system and
external systems.
